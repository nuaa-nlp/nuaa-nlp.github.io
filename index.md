### 
2021年6月1日，南京航空航天大学自然语言处理实验室(NUAA NLP LAB)开始筹备。实验室Leader为李丕绩博士。主要研究大方向为自然语言理解、自然语言生成、可信人工智能 (与南航智能与安全实验室合作)等。

### Leader Biography
I am a professor in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and I lead the NUAA NLP Group. Previously, I was a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2018, under the supervision of Prof. Wai Lam. Before joining CUHK, I was a full-time R&D Engineer at Baidu Inc. and Wumii Inc. I received my master and bachelor degree from School of Computer Science and Technology in Shandong University from 2005 to 2012, under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Ma](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/~junma/~junma_en.htm).
<!-- 李丕绩，男，南京航空航天大学计算机科学与技术学院/人工智能学院教授，2021年度南京航空航天大学"长空学者"获得者，2021年ACM南京分会新星奖。香港中文大学博士，曾任腾讯AI Lab自然语言处理中心高级研究员、百度商务搜索部研发工程师。研究方向主要为自然语言处理，包括预训练模型、信息检索、文本挖掘、文本生成和对话系统。曾经在相关领域顶级会议如ACL、EMNLP、SIGIR、WWW等发表学术论文50余篇。受邀担任了ACL、NeurIPS等相关会议的程序委员会委员和审稿人，并担任了EMNLP2020和IJCAI2021的领域主席，期刊Neurocomputing的Associate Editor。在工业界工作期间负责了多个语言理解、文本生成和智能对话相关重要项目的算法研发和产品发布，有丰富的科研落地实践经验。目前主持国家自然科学基金-青年基金一项。 -->
