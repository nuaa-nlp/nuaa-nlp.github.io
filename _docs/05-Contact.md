# Contact us

We are looking for motivated students who are enthusiastic about natural language processing and machine learning to join our group. If you are interested in our research, feel free to reach out to us! (see below for details)

## PhD students

If you are not a current Princeton student, please apply directly to the graduate program in Princeton CS and mention you are interested in NLP/ML in your application. We are unable to respond to individual emails unfortunately.
If you are already at Princeton, feel free to email us to setup a time to chat.
## Undergraduate students

Please send us an email with your resume and updated transcript. We strongly recommend that you take at least one machine learning course before embarking on NLP/ML research.
